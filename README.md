## üìñ About The Project

This was a personal project to see how far I could push Python for real-time system automation and input emulation. The goal was to build a full-featured application to manage and simulate recoil control patterns, focusing on sophisticated "humanization" techniques to make the simulated mouse movements appear less robotic and more organic.

## ‚ú® Technical Features

*   **Custom GUI:** The entire interface is built with CustomTkinter, featuring a modern, borderless window and animated frame transitions.
*   **Advanced Humanization Engine:**
    *   **Perlin Noise:** Injects smooth, organic jitter into mouse movements to avoid perfectly straight lines.
    *   **Quadratic Easing:** Implements an ease-out function so mouse movements feel more natural, starting fast and slowing down.
    *   **Randomized Timings:** The delay between actions and the initial reaction time are randomized within set boundaries.
    *   **Circular Randomization:** Corrections are applied to a random point within a circle around the target pixel, not always to the exact same spot.
*   **Low-Level Input Handling:** Uses `pynput` in separate, non-blocking threads to listen for mouse and keyboard events without freezing the GUI.
*   **String Obfuscation:** Weapon names and other strings are hidden in memory using a simple XOR cipher to explore basic signature scanning evasion techniques.
*   **Configuration Management:** All settings (sensitivity, FOV, DPI, etc.) are saved to and loaded from a `config.json` file.

## üöÄ How to Run (For Analysis Only)

1.  **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  **Install the required libraries**:
    ```sh
    pip install customtkinter pynput Pillow perlin-noise-python
    ```
3.  **Place Required Files**: Ensure the `Brand.png` and `config.json` files are in the same directory as the script.
4.  **Run the main script from your terminal**:
    ```sh
    python 1.py
    ```
